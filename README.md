# Techxcelerate Hackathon

# Team name : Emerald Edgers

# Project name : Skill Marketplace for College Students

# Problem Statement
Many college students struggle to find freelance gigs and internships that match their skills, while startups and small businesses find it difficult to connect with talented students. Our platform bridges this gap by providing a student-focused skill marketplace where : 
- Students can list their skills and find short-term paid gigs.
- Startups & individuals can post job opportunities and hire skilled students.
- A searchable, filterable job board helps both parties connect efficiently.
  
# Solution
We are building a web-based skill marketplace where:
- Students create profiles showcasing their skills.
- Employers post short-term gigs and projects.
- Students apply for jobs, and employers can review applicants.
- Real-time updates help users manage applications.
  
# Features (MVP for First Submission)
- User Authentication (Signup/Login)
- Student Profiles (Name, skills, portfolio link)
- Gig Posting & Listings (Title, description, required skills, budget)
- Job Search & Filtering (Basic search function)
- API Endpoints for Jobs & Users
